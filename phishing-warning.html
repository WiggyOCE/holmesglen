        <h3>Learn to Protect Yourself:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verify the sender:</strong> Always check the sender’s email address and look for anything unusual.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for HTTPS:</strong> Ensure the URL starts with “https” and includes the lock icon.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid urgent language:</strong> Phishing emails often use urgent language to make you act quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Never click unknown links:</strong> Hover over links to verify the destination before clicking.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact the organisation directly:</strong> If unsure, reach out to the company through official channels.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Remember, your awareness is the best defence against phishing threats!</p>
